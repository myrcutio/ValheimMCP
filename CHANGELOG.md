## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added
- Standalone BepInEx plugin exposing a localhost HTTP endpoint for driving
  Valheim's in-game console.
- Plain HTTP routes for scripting: `GET /health`, `GET /commands`,
  `POST /command`.
- Native in-process MCP transport (`POST /mcp`, Streamable-HTTP / JSON-RPC 2.0)
  with tools: `run_command`, `list_commands`, `health`, `render_view`.
- Off-screen camera rendering (`render_view`) returning a PNG inline, without
  touching the player's view.
- Dependency-free config at `BepInEx/config/valheimmcp.yml`, including an
  `allow`/`deny` command access-control list.

### Known limitations
- Output from commands that print asynchronously (coroutines, e.g. screenshot
  capture) is not captured — only output printed synchronously during the call.
